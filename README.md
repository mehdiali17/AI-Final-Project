Project name: 
Hand Written Mathematical equation solver.

Details: 
This system will first localize the provided input and then use [TSNE embeddings](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) to recognize digits. After this it will use [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) to solve this equation and display the result.
